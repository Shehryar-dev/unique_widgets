# Unique Widgets

## About the Project
I created this project to enhance my Flutter skills by practicing advanced and unique widgets. The goal is to explore different widgets, understand their capabilities, and improve my development expertise through hands-on implementation.

## How It Works
- Each day, I will practice and push a new widget to this repository.
- The project serves as a personal learning resource and a contribution to the Flutter community.
- The repository will continuously grow with useful Flutter widgets that can be referenced for future projects.

## Widgets Implemented
- [x] **Hero Widget** (Added on: *April 3, 2025*)
